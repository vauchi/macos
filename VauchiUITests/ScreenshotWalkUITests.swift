// Screenshot walk — captures every reachable screen so CI publishes a
// gallery of what the app looks like on this commit.
//
// Not a visual regression test: nothing is compared against a baseline.
// The assertions only prove that the walk produced captures and that the
// destination captures are not the same frame over and over (which is what
// a stuck overlay or a dead tap would produce). PNG files go to the directory
// named by `VAUCHI_SCREENSHOT_DIR` (reaches the runner as
// `TEST_RUNNER_VAUCHI_SCREENSHOT_DIR` on the xcodebuild command line) and
// always to the xcresult as attachments, so a run without the variable
// still leaves the gallery in the result bundle.
//
// Drives the app only through the stable frontend a11y identifiers
// (`command.*`, `navigationDestinations`) — never core action ids or
// localized labels, which are Core's to change. Same walk as the iOS
// shell's `ScreenshotWalkUITests`, with clicks for taps and the window
// as the capture source.
